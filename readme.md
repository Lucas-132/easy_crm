# Easy Customer Relationship Manager 💼👔📧
This web app will allow you to manage a list of clients/prospects, store their name, their email, their phone number, their company name and more.

In the final version you will be able to store all of this information inside a SQL relational database hosted on your server.

## 🚨👷🏻 Warning, work in progress 👷🏻🛠️
The development of this web app is currently in progress and is not ready to use. For now I'm still working on the backend, there are still more features coming !
